Here are the exact configurations followed to achieve f1_score_mean equal to 0.521827830393 and f1_score_weighted equal to 0.875794078693 for the Opportunity Dataset using a DNN

1)50% overlap in the sliding windows.

2)Parameters:
window size = 23 (creates approximately 650k samples)
labels = 18
features/measurements = 77
batch size = 64
learning rate = 0.0005
training epochs = 20000

3)Model:

3 hidden layers of 256 neurons each.
1 fully connected layer with 512 neurons
Each layer passes through ReLU activation function and a
max pooling layer. The dropout rate is 0.1 for the first layer
0.25 for the second and 0.5 for the third one and the fully connected layer.
during training.
Kernel sizes (for the convolution) : 
kernel_size_1 = 7
kernel_size_2 = 3
kernel_size_3 = 1

4)Optimization function:
Stohastic Gradient Descent optimizer to minimize negative log likelihood

5)Results:

f1_score_mean 0.521827830393
