Here are the exact configurations followed to achieve f1_score_mean equal to 0.950636942675 and f1_score_weighted equal to 0.950284090788 for the Pamap2 Dataset using a FFLSTM


1)50% overlap in the sliding windows.

2)Parameters:
window size = 25 (creates approximately 430k samples)
labels = 11
features/measurements = 52
batch size = 64
learning rate = 0.0005
training epochs = 10000

3)Model:

64 neurons inside each hidden layer.
2 hidden layers stacked
The dropout rate is 0.5 for all the layers during training.

4)Optimization function:

Adagrad optimizer to minimize negative log likelihood

5)Results:


f1_score_mean 0.950636942675
f1_score_weighted 0.950284090788
