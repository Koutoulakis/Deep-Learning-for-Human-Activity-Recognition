Here are the exact configurations followed to achieve f1_score_mean equal to 0.642425453624 and f1_score_weighted equal to 0.904361807891 for the Opportunity Dataset using a FFLSTM

1)50% overlap in the sliding windows.

2)Parameters:
window size = 23 (creates approximately 650k samples)
labels = 18
features/measurements = 77
batch size = 64
learning rate = 0.001
training epochs = 10000

3)Model:

2 stacked forward layers of 64 neurons each.
The dropout rate is 0.5 for all the layers
during training.

5)Optimization function:
Adam Optimizer minimizing negative log likelihood

6)Results:
f1_score_mean 0.642425453624
f1_score_weighted 0.904361807891
