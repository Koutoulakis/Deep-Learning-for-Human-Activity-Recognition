Here are the exact configurations followed to achieve f1_score_mean equal to 0.898089171975 and f1_score_weighted equal to 0.896746005494 for the Pamap2 Dataset using a BDLSTM

1)50% overlap in the sliding windows.

2)Parameters:
window size = 25 (creates approximately 430k samples)
labels = 11
features/measurements = 52
batch size = 64
learning rate = 0.001
training epochs = 10000

3)Model:

128 neurons inside each hidden layer.
2 hidden layers stacked
The dropout rate is 0.5 for all the layers during training.

4)Optimization function:

Adam optimizer to minimize negative log likelihood

5)Results:

f1_score_mean 0.898089171975
f1_score_weighted 0.896746005494
