Here are the exact configurations followed to achieve f1_score_mean equal to 0.597588826511 and f1_score_weighted equal to 0.894410382181 for the Opportunity Dataset using a CNN

1)50% overlap in the sliding windows.

2)Parameters:
window size = 23 (creates approximately 650k samples)
labels = 2
features/measurements = 77
batch size = 64
learning rate = 0.0005
training epochs = 1000

3)Model:

3 hidden layers of 128 neurons each.
1 fully connected layer with 512 neurons
Each layer passes through ReLU activation function and a
max pooling layer. The dropout rate is 0.1 for the first layer
0.25 for the second and 0.5 for the third one (fully connected)
during training.
Kernel sizes (for the convolution) : 
kernel_size_1 = 7
kernel_size_2 = 3
kernel_size_3 = 1

4)Optimization function:
Adam optimizer to minimize negative log likelihood

5)Results:


f1_score_mean 0.597588826511
f1_score_weighted 0.894410382181
